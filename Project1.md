As a general note, be sure to keep a record of any resources that you use or refer to in the creation of your project. You will need to report your sources as part of the project submission.

1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?

dependent variable is time how much time participants took to read the color of the word.
independent variable is a number of the two congruent and incongruent words, a number of color used in the two word sets. As more words there are, as more time will take to read word set.




2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.

Null hypothesis (H0)
The null hypothesis is that the congruent and incongruent come from the same population. Even we could see there is a difference in sample means but actually there is no difference in population of mean time.
H0: μ(congruent) = μ(incongruent) or
H0: μ(congruent) ≥ μ(incongruent)

Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
There is a difference between the population of mean time of the congruent and the incongruent test. The difference from each sample means presents they are different in the population as well.
H1: μ(Congruent)≠ μ(incongruent) or
H1: μ(Congruent) < μ(incongruent)

Dependent test is needed to be performed.
two different condition of the tests will be performed for the same person and measure the time to take for each condition.
There are 24 samples and we don’t know the population information. It seems like using t-score is more appropriate to be used here.







Now it’s your chance to try out the Stroop task for yourself. Go to this link, which has a Java-based applet for performing the Stroop task. Record the times that you received on the task (you do not need to submit your times to the site.) Now, download this dataset which contains results from a number of participants in the task. Each row of the dataset contains the performance for one participant, with the first number their results on the congruent task and the second number their performance on the incongruent task.



3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.

4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.
The average time took around 10~15s for the congruent and a little more than 20~25s due to the frequency of the time range 30~40s. We could say that it takes more time to take the incongruent test than the congruent test.

5. Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level and your critical statistic value? Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?

Null hypotheses.
The population mean of the time took from Congruent is equal to the population mean of the time took from Incongruent
Alternative hypotheses.
The population mean of the time took from Congruent is different from the population mean of the time took from Incongruent


Reject the Null hypothesis because t-score (-8.02) is far from the t-value at the alpha level of 0.05(95%) and 23 degree of freedom. 5.91s to 10.01s fewer times taken from the congruent test compared to the incongruent test

Yes, it does match as I expected.
